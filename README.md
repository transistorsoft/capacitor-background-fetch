------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Background Fetch* is a *very* simple plugin which attempts to awaken an app in the background about **every 15 minutes**, providing a short period of background running-time.  This plugin will execute your provided `callbackFn` whenever a background-fetch event occurs.

There is **no way** to increase the rate which a fetch-event occurs and this plugin sets the rate to the most frequent possible &mdash; you will **never** receive an event faster than **15 minutes**.  The operating-system will automatically throttle the rate the background-fetch events occur based upon usage patterns.  Eg: if user hasn't turned on their phone for a long period of time, fetch events will occur less frequently or if an iOS user disables background refresh they may not happen at all.

:new: Background Fetch now provides a [__`scheduleTask`__](#executing-custom-tasks) method for scheduling arbitrary "one-shot" or periodic tasks.

### iOS
- There is **no way** to increase the rate which a fetch-event occurs and this plugin sets the rate to the most frequent possible &mdash; you will **never** receive an event faster than **15 minutes**.  The operating-system will automatically throttle the rate the background-fetch events occur based upon usage patterns.  Eg: if user hasn't turned on their phone for a long period of time, fetch events will occur less frequently.
- [__`scheduleTask`__](#executing-custom-tasks) seems only to fire when the device is plugged into power.
- ⚠️ When your app is **terminated**, iOS *no longer fires events* &mdash; There is *no such thing* as [__`stopOnTerminate: false`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/interfaces/backgroundfetchconfig.html#stoponterminate) for iOS.
- iOS can take *days* before Apple's machine-learning algorithm settles in and begins regularly firing events.  Do not sit staring at your logs waiting for an event to fire.  If your [*simulated events*](#debugging) work, that's all you need to know that everything is correctly configured.
- If the user doesn't open your *iOS* app for long periods of time, *iOS* will **stop firing events**.

### Android
- The Android plugin provides a __*Headless*__ mechanism allowing you to continue handling events even after app-termination (see [Receiving Events After App Termination](#receiving-events-after-app-termination-1))

## Example ##

:information_source: This repo contains its own *Example App*.  See [`/example`](./example/README.md)

#### Angular Example:

- See API Docs [__`BackgroundFetch.configure`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/classes/backgroundfetch.html#configure)

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

import {BackgroundFetch} from '@transistorsoft/capacitor-background-fetch';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {
  constructor() {}

  // Initialize in ngAfterContentInit
  // [WARNING] DO NOT use ionViewWillEnter, as that method won't run when app is launched in background.
  ngAfterContentInit() {
    this.initBackgroundFetch();
  }

  async initBackgroundFetch() {
    const status = await BackgroundFetch.configure({
      minimumFetchInterval: 15
    }, async (taskId) => {
      console.log('[BackgroundFetch] EVENT:', taskId);
      // Perform your work in an awaited Promise
      const result = await this.performYourWorkHere();
      console.log('[BackgroundFetch] work complete:', result);
      // [REQUIRED] Signal to the OS that your work is complete.
      BackgroundFetch.finish(taskId);
    }, async (taskId) => {
      // The OS has signalled that your remaining background-time has expired.
      // You must immediately complete your work and signal #finish.
      console.log('[BackgroundFetch] TIMEOUT:', taskId);
      // [REQUIRED] Signal to the OS that your work is complete.
      BackgroundFetch.finish(taskId);
    });

    // Checking BackgroundFetch status:
    if (status !== BackgroundFetch.STATUS_AVAILABLE) {
      // Uh-oh:  we have a problem:
      if (status === BackgroundFetch.STATUS_DENIED) {
        alert('The user explicitly disabled background behavior for this app or for the whole system.');
      } else if (status === BackgroundFetch.STATUS_RESTRICTED) {
        alert('Background updates are unavailable and the user cannot enable them again.')
      }
    }
  }

  async performYourWorkHere() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(true);
      }, 5000);
    });
  }
}
```

## Receiving Events After App Termination

- Only Android is able to continue receiving events after app termination.  See API Docs [__`enableHeadless`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/interfaces/backgroundfetchconfig.html#enableheadless).
- For iOS, there is __NO SUCH THING__ as [__`stopOnTerminate: false`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/interfaces/backgroundfetchconfig.html#stoponterminate).  When an iOS app is terminated, the OS will **no longer fire events**.

## Executing Custom Tasks

In addition to the default background-fetch task defined by [__`BackgroundFetch.configure`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/classes/backgroundfetch.html#configure), you may also execute your own arbitrary "oneshot" or periodic tasks (iOS requires additional [Setup Instructions](help/INSTALL-IOS.md#configure-infoplist-new-ios-13)).  See API Docs [__`BackgroundFetch.scheduleTask`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/classes/backgroundfetch.html#scheduletask).  However, all events will be fired into the Callback provided to [__`BackgroundFetch.configure`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/classes/backgroundfetch.html#configure).

### ⚠️ iOS:
- [__`BackgroundFetch.scheduleTask`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/classes/backgroundfetch.html#scheduletask) on *iOS* seems only to run when the device is plugged into power.
- [__`BackgroundFetch.scheduleTask`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/classes/backgroundfetch.html#scheduletask) on *iOS* are designed for *low-priority* tasks, such as purging cache files &mdash; they tend to be **unreliable for mission-critical tasks**.  [__`BackgroundFetch.scheduleTask`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/classes/backgroundfetch.html#scheduletask) will *never* run as frequently as you want.
- The default `fetch` event is much more reliable and fires far more often.
- [__`BackgroundFetch.scheduleTask`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/classes/backgroundfetch.html#scheduletask) on *iOS* stop when the *user* terminates the app.  There is no such thing as [__`stopOnTerminate: false`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/interfaces/backgroundfetchconfig.html#stoponterminate) for *iOS*.

```javascript
// Step 1:  Configure BackgroundFetch as usual.
let status = await BackgroundFetch.configure({
  minimumFetchInterval: 15
}, async (taskId) => {  // <-- Event callback
  // This is the fetch-event callback.
  console.log("[BackgroundFetch] taskId: ", taskId);

  // Use a switch statement to route task-handling.
  switch (taskId) {
    case 'com.foo.customtask':
      print("Received custom task");
      break;
    default:
      print("Default fetch task");
  }
  // Finish, providing received taskId.
  BackgroundFetch.finish(taskId);
}, async (taskId) => {  // <-- Task timeout callback
  // This task has exceeded its allowed running-time.
  // You must stop what you're doing and immediately .finish(taskId)
  BackgroundFetch.finish(taskId);
});

// Step 2:  Schedule a custom "oneshot" task "com.foo.customtask" to execute 5000ms from now.
BackgroundFetch.scheduleTask({
  taskId: "com.foo.customtask",
  forceAlarmManager: true,
  delay: 5000  // <-- milliseconds
});
```


## Debugging

### iOS Simulated Events

#### :new: `BGTaskScheduler` API for iOS 13+

- :warning: At the time of writing, the new task simulator does not yet work in Simulator; Only real devices.  Use [Old BackgroundFetch API](#old-backgroundfetch-api) so simulate events in Simulator.
- See Apple docs [Starting and Terminating Tasks During Development](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/starting_and_terminating_tasks_during_development?language=objc)
- After running your app in XCode, Click the `[||]` button to initiate a *Breakpoint*.
- In the console `(lldb)`, paste the following command (**Note:**  use cursor up/down keys to cycle through previously run commands):
```obj-c
e -l objc -- (void)[[BGTaskScheduler sharedScheduler] _simulateLaunchForTaskWithIdentifier:@"com.transistorsoft.fetch"]
```
- Click the `[ > ]` button to continue.  The task will execute and the Callback function provided to [__`BackgroundFetch.configure`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/classes/backgroundfetch.html#configure) will receive the event.

#### Simulating task-timeout events

- Only the new `BGTaskScheduler` api supports *simulated* task-timeout events.  To simulate a task-timeout, your `fetchCallback` must not call [__`BackgroundFetch.finish(taskId)`__](https://transistorsoft.github.io/capacitor-background-fetch/classes/backgroundfetch.html#finish):

```javascript
const status = await BackgroundFetch.configure({
  minimumFetchInterval: 15
}, async (taskId) => {  // <-- Event callback.
  // This is the task callback.
  console.log("[BackgroundFetch] taskId", taskId);
  //BackgroundFetch.finish(taskId); // <-- Disable .finish(taskId) when simulating an iOS task timeout
}, async (taskId) => {  // <-- Event timeout callback
  // This task has exceeded its allowed running-time.
  // You must stop what you're doing and immediately .finish(taskId)
  console.log("[BackgroundFetch] TIMEOUT taskId:", taskId);
  BackgroundFetch.finish(taskId);
});
```

- Now simulate an iOS task timeout as follows, in the same manner as simulating an event above:
```obj-c
e -l objc -- (void)[[BGTaskScheduler sharedScheduler] _simulateExpirationForTaskWithIdentifier:@"com.transistorsoft.fetch"]
```

#### Old `BackgroundFetch` API
- Simulate background fetch events in XCode using **`Debug->Simulate Background Fetch`**
- iOS can take some hours or even days to start a consistently scheduling background-fetch events since iOS schedules fetch events based upon the user's patterns of activity.  If *Simulate Background Fetch* works, your can be **sure** that everything is working fine.  You just need to wait.

### Android Simulated Events

- Observe plugin logs in `$ adb logcat`:

```bash
$ adb logcat *:S TSBackgroundFetch:V Capacitor/Console:V Capacitor/Plugin:V
```

- Simulate a background-fetch event on a device (insert *&lt;your.application.id&gt;*) (only works for sdk `21+`:
```bash
$ adb shell cmd jobscheduler run -f <your.application.id> 999
```
- For devices with sdk `<21`, simulate a "Headless JS" event with (insert *&lt;your.application.id&gt;*)
```bash
$ adb shell am broadcast -a <your.application.id>.event.BACKGROUND_FETCH

```
